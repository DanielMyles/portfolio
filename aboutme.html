                                                  I've found I enjoy the world of web development and graphic design, <br>
                                                I've built a lot of experience in the area by doing projects<br> 
                                       for different clientele and helping them achieve their graphic design <br>
                                   goals by working with them closely, paying attention to the small details,<br> 
                                                       and applying unique interpretation techniques that <br>
                                                            lead to a finished product and a satisfied client.<br><br><br>
														All that is well and good , but I guess your wanting<br>
														some background.<br><br><br>
														So I was born in Fort MacMurray, moved to Newfoundland<br>
														where i went to school and graduated.<br>
														Was fascinated by the arts and got involved with music in general.<br>
														I moved out west about 20 years ago and gradually started<br>
														surrounding myself with web development and graphic art rather than the music side of things<br><br><br>
